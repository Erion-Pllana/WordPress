AI PROMPT — Booking & Appointment Website (Design-First)

Role: You are a senior UX/UI designer and WordPress website architect.

Task: Design a high-end booking & appointment website for a professional service (therapist / coach / consultant / barber). The website must feel calm, trustworthy, modern, and premium, with design quality as the top priority, while still supporting real-world booking logic.

Primary Focus (Very Important):
The visual design and user experience matter more than features. The website should look like something a real client would trust immediately. Avoid generic layouts. Use strong typography, spacing, color harmony, and subtle animations.

Design Requirements:

Calm, professional, confidence-inspiring aesthetic

Soft neutral color palette (beige, off-white, muted greens/blues)

Clean typography (serif for headings, modern sans-serif for body)

Large whitespace and clear visual hierarchy

Smooth, subtle transitions (no flashy animations)

Mobile-first and responsive

Clear call-to-action buttons (“Book a Session”, “Check Availability”)

Pages to Design:

Homepage

Strong hero section with a calming headline

Short trust-building intro

Primary CTA: “Book an Appointment”

Services Page

Clearly presented service offerings

Duration and pricing shown cleanly

Booking Page

Simple, minimal booking flow

Calendar view with available time slots

Step-by-step process (choose service → choose time → confirm)

About / Trust Page

Professional bio

Credentials or experience

Friendly, human tone

Contact Page

Minimal form

Reassuring copy

Booking Logic (Functional, Not Overcomplicated):

Time slot availability

Prevent double bookings

Booking confirmation message

Email notification to client and service provider

Simple cancellation or rescheduling rules

WordPress Constraints:

Must be realistic to build with WordPress

Assume booking handled via a plugin (e.g., Amelia, Bookly, or similar)

Custom styling and layout are essential

Output Expectations:

Describe the visual style in detail

Explain layout decisions

Emphasize why the design builds trust

Keep logic clean, realistic, and client-ready

Overall Goal:
Create a portfolio-worthy booking website that looks premium, feels calm, and would realistically convert visitors into bookings for a real professional.
