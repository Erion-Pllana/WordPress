Build a role-based booking and appointment platform for service-based professionals such as therapists, coaches, consultants, barbers, or tutors.

The system should allow clients to book services with providers based on real-time availability, while enforcing custom user roles and permissions.

User Roles:

Admin: Manage users, approve providers, view all bookings, configure global booking rules, services, and notifications.

Provider: Create and edit a professional profile, define services offered (duration, price, session type), manage availability and time slots, view upcoming and past bookings, and receive booking notifications.

Client: Browse providers and services, book appointments by selecting a date and time, view booking history, and receive confirmation and reminder emails.

Booking Logic:

Time-slot-based scheduling

Real-time availability checks to prevent double bookings

Booking confirmation and cancellation rules

Optional rescheduling and payment support

Design Requirements:

Calm, trustworthy, professional UI

Simple, step-by-step booking forms

Clear calls-to-action

Mobile-friendly layout

Notifications:

Email confirmations for bookings, updates, and reminders

The platform should be scalable, easy to understand, and suitable as a real-world business solution or portfolio project.
